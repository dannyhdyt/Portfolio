## About me
 In my three-year journey within merchandise operations, my primary focus has been on perfecting pricing strategies, accurate stock forecasting, and providing sales performance insights to suppliers. On 2 December 2023, I embarked on a Quality Assurance Engineer mini boot camp, where I learned to create detailed test cases, to basic programming in Java, and learn tools like Postman for API testing and Katalon for automation.

I am enthusiastic about transitioning into the realm of Quality Assurance. I'm excited to apply this broad skill set, aiming to enhance product quality, streamline processes, and greatly enhance the success of any team or company working in the field of quality assurance.
