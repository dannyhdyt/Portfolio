## About me
In my three-year journey within merchandise operations, my primary focus has been on perfecting pricing strategies, accurate stock forecasting, and providing sales performance insights to suppliers.

Recently, I embarked on a Quality Assurance Engineer mini boot camp where I learned to create detailed test cases, delved into basic programming in Java, and learned tools like Postman for API testing and Katalon for automation.

I am enthusiastic about transitioning into the realm of Quality Assurance and excited to apply these skills. The knowledge I have gained will be very useful for building a career in this field.
